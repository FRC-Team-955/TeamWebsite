            <p>The Crescent Valley High School Robotics Team was founded in September 2002 by engineering teacher Mark Baldwin and twelve students. Our team (<abbr title="FIRST Robotics Competition">FRC</abbr> Team 955) is part of the NASA sponsored <abbr title="For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology">FIRST</abbr> program. Each year we compete in the worldwide FRC challenge.</p>
            <p>Since our founding we have grown into more than just a robotics team. We have become a family of over 40 diverse students connected by a shared passion for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM). Our current coach, Jim Bowey, leads this group of students, mentors, parents, and business partners in the pursuit of our shared passion. </p>

                    <p>We constantly strive to increase the amount of time we spend volunteering, primarily by going to elementary schools to actively engage younger students in science and technology education. This extends to middle schools as well. This is a way to spread the FIRST message while recruiting inspired students for future years. We highly value promoting enthusiasm for science and technology in younger students.</p>

                      <p>We aim to increase the number of partnerships within the local community to promote investment in FIRST and its programs. This will allow the team to exert less effort in fundraising, and put a larger amount of effort into community outreach programs, like Da Vinci Days. Such partnerships link us to our community, and maintaining these partnerships increases the sustainability of our program in future years.</p>

            <p>The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international varsity sport of the mind designed to help high-school-aged young people discover how interesting and rewarding the life of engineers and researchers can be. The FIRST Robotics Competition tests the ability of teams and their mentors to complete a challenge in a six-week time frame using a common set of rules. Teams build robots from industrial-grade parts and enter them in competitions designed by Dean Kamen, Dr. Woodie Flowers, and a committee of engineers and other professionals. FIRST redefines winning for these students because they are rewarded for more than just their robot's ability to win. Not only are teams recognized for excellence and creativity in robot design, but they must also demonstrate team spirit, involvement in their communities, gracious professionalism, maturity, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Scoring the most points is a secondary goal. Winning means building skills and partnerships that last.
