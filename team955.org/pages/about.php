            <p>The Crescent Valley High School Robotics Team (<abbr title="FIRST Robotics Competition">FRC</abbr> Team 955) was founded in September 2002 by engineering teacher Mark Baldwin, an applied arts teacher at Crescent Valley High School. We are now a 14 year old FIRST Robotics team, and have grown from just twelve students in 2002 to a family of over 40 diverse students in recent years. The team is a club activity at Crescent Valley High School in Corvallis Oregon, and is a part of the NASA sponsored <abbr title="For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology">FIRST</abbr> program. Each year we participate in community education and outreach activities, and compete in local robotics competitions and the worldwide FRC challenge.</p>
            <p>To spread the word about robotics, the team participates in local science and engineering fairs as well as various other community events. From the Da Vinci Days Scrimmage to the Philomath Frolic, the students teach community members about the program. The team also goes to local middle schools and attends elementary school science fairs to encourage the students to explore science and technology, and possibly join our team when they go into high school.</p>

          </section>
          <section class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3">
            <p>We constantly strive to increase the amount of time we spend volunteering, primarily by going to elementary schools to actively engage younger students in science and technology education. This extends to middle schools as well. This is a way to spread the FIRST message while recruiting inspired students for future years. We highly value promoting enthusiasm for science and technology in younger students.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="quarterRow col-xs-12 col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3">
            <p>A goal of ours is also to streamline fundraising methods that allow the team to work towards providing funds for our program while still allowing students to focus on participating in robotics. We hope that by establishing annual community fundraisers, such as Motherâ€™s Day flower sales, our program will become sustainable and decrease the overall time we spend fundraising to allow for more robotics activities.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="quarterRow col-xs-12 col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3">
            <p>We aim to increase the number of partnerships within the local community to promote investment in FIRST and its programs. This will allow the team to exert less effort in fundraising, and put a larger amount of effort into community outreach programs, like Da Vinci Days. Such partnerships link us to our community, and maintaining these partnerships increases the sustainability of our program in future years.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="quarterRow col-xs-12 col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3">
            <p>As well as raise the current level of awareness of all sub-team activities within our team. This will allow our team to better function as a whole, and create less miscommunication between sub-teams, like coordinating team activities that involve all members; including fundraisers, or even competition deadlines.</p>

              <p>FIRST stands for "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology." It is a non-profit organization that seeks to boost interest in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) and develop young people into leaders of those fields. Founded in 1989, FIRST has created many team-structured opportunities to help accomplish their goal, such as FLL, FTC, and FRC.</p>
              <p>The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international varsity sport of the mind designed to help high-school-aged young people discover how interesting and rewarding the life of engineers and researchers can be. The FIRST Robotics Competition tests the ability of teams and their mentors to complete a challenge in a six-week time frame using a common set of rules. Teams build robots from industrial-grade parts and enter them in competitions designed by Dean Kamen, Dr. Woodie Flowers, and a committee of engineers and other professionals. FIRST redefines winning for these students because they are rewarded for more than just their robot's ability to win. Not only are teams recognized for excellence and creativity in robot design, but they must also demonstrate team spirit, involvement in their communities, gracious professionalism, maturity, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Scoring the most points is a secondary goal. Winning means building skills and partnerships that last.

              <p>Recently, Brandeis University's Center for Youth and Communities conducted an independent, retrospective survey of FIRST Robotics Competition participants and compared results to a group of non-FIRST students with similar backgrounds and academic experiences, including math and science. Highlights of the study's findings include: When compared with the comparison group, FIRST students are: Significantly more likely to attend college on a full-time basis than comparison students (88% vs. 53%) More than 3 times as likely to major specifically in engineering. Roughly 10 times as likely to have had an apprenticeship, internship, or co-op job in their freshman year. Significantly more likely to expect to achieve a postgraduate degree. More than twice as likely to expect to pursue a career in science and technology. Nearly 4 times as likely to expect to pursue a career specifically in engineering. More than twice as likely to volunteer in their communities. You can see the whole survey <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/impact" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Our team utilizes a fairly flat engineering leadership structure. Team responsibilities are divided among the two program managers, Ryan Dunn and Parker Lewis.  The two managers essentially plan large scale activities: one manager for the robot side and one for the business side. Other student leaders work with them to help lead the various sub-teams. This provides numerous opportunities for students to develop technical, business, leaderships and organizational skills.</p>
