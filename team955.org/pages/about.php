            <p>The Crescent Valley High School Robotics Team was founded in September 2002 by engineering teacher Mark Baldwin and twelve students. Our team (<abbr title="FIRST Robotics Competition">FRC</abbr> Team 955) is part of the NASA sponsored <abbr title="For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology">FIRST</abbr> program. Each year we compete in the worldwide FRC challenge.</p>
            <p>Since our founding we have grown into more than just a robotics team. We have become a family of over 40 diverse students connected by a shared passion for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM). Our current coach, Jim Bowey, leads this group of students, mentors, parents, and business partners in the pursuit of our shared passion. </p>

                    <p>We constantly strive to increase the amount of time we spend volunteering, primarily by going to elementary schools to actively engage younger students in science and technology education. This extends to middle schools as well. This is a way to spread the FIRST message while recruiting inspired students for future years. We highly value promoting enthusiasm for science and technology in younger students.</p>

                      <p>A goal of ours is also to streamline fundraising methods that allow the team to work towards providing funds for our program while still allowing students to focus on participating in robotics. We hope that by establishing annual community fundraisers, such as Motherâ€™s Day flower sales, our program will become sustainable and decrease the overall time we spend fundraising to allow for more robotics activities.</p>

                      <p>We aim to increase the number of partnerships within the local community to promote investment in FIRST and its programs. This will allow the team to exert less effort in fundraising, and put a larger amount of effort into community outreach programs, like Da Vinci Days. Such partnerships link us to our community, and maintaining these partnerships increases the sustainability of our program in future years.</p>

                      <p>As well as raise the current level of awareness of all sub-team activities within our team. This will allow our team to better function as a whole, and create less miscommunication between sub-teams, like coordinating team activities that involve all members; including fundraisers, or even competition deadlines.</p>
