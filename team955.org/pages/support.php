              <p>It's not about the robot. The robotics program at Crescent Valley High School is about teamwork and building a family. It's about learning that hard work and long hours can lead to success. It's about learning that failure is part of pushing yourself to try new things and learn. It's about making sure that everyone contributes and feels valuable. The robot is just the vehicle.</p>
              <q>Robotics goes beyond friendship - we're an extended family. We meet people with the same interests and we learn from each other - and it's fun. We learn how to pull it all together to build something REAL and compete in an awesome event. What's not to love about Robotics?

              <p>Sponsors are a key component of our team, providing funds and supplies to support building the robot and other team activities.  We send sponsors newsletters during the year to keep them up to date with our work, and show them the results of their support.  We visit sponsors in person to build solid relationships and lasting partnerships, which in turn helps us with machining parts and getting donated materials.  Sponsors are invited to all of our robotics scrimmages, outreach events, and competitions. They are also invited to come visit us during the build season to see us at work.  In exchange for their donation, sponsors are also given different levels of recognition depending on the size of the donation.  These recognition levels are explained in the donations section.</p>
